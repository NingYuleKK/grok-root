In the past, I tried to build products by mood: when I felt inspired, I sprinted; when energy dropped, everything stalled. The result looked busy but was not shippable.

This week I changed one thing: I made process non-negotiable. Every task followed the same flow:

1. Define acceptance criteria
2. Implement small and reversible changes
3. Show runnable proof
4. Update memory and decisions docs

The shift sounds simple, but it changed my confidence. I no longer need to feel ready to start. I run the workflow, and momentum appears as a side effect.

Creativity drives ideas; workflow ships products.
