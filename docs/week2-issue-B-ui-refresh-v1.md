# [feat] Issue B - UI Refresh v1 (Layout + Typography + Responsive)

## Goal
- Establish a consistent and readable UI baseline across homepage, post pages, and tags pages.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Header/footer baseline
  - Post typography and spacing
  - Homepage post list cards
  - Tag chip styles
  - Basic SEO meta (`title`, `description`)
- Out of scope:
  - Advanced animation system
  - Theme switching system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Mobile and desktop readability is improved with clear navigation and link/button states.
- [x] Homepage list and post page share one consistent typography/spacing system.
- [x] Issue A routes and tags behavior remain intact; build still passes.

## Constraints
- Tech/runtime constraints:
  - Preserve Astro structure and content collections from Issue A.
- Time/scope constraints:
  - Keep this iteration focused on baseline polish, not design-system expansion.

- Additional context:
  - Record UI conventions in README or docs (naming/spacing/typography choices).
